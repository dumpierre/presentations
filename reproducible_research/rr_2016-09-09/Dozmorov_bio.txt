Dr. Mikhail Dozmorov is assistant professor in the Biostatistics department at VCU. He is working in computational genomics and epigenomics of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and aging. Through collaborations, Dr. Dozmorov analyses and interprets next generation sequencing data, ranging from RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNA methylation through whole exome/genome sequencing datasets. He develops methods for better understanding the biology behind 'big data', such as the use of linear modeling for cell type-specific differential expression analysis. He extensively works with data from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, as well as The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA), focusing on statistical methods for diagnostics, survival analysis and treatment decisions.
